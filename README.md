# Bokluk's dragon heist

Metroidvania game for the [Metroidvania Month 18 Jam](https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-18)

Bokluk is a small goblin fed up with his boring life. What he really really wants in life are shiny things! A rumor says a dragon lives in the depths of mount Atros. And dragons have a lot or shiny riches, dont' they?
